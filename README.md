# IndirectMethod

This repository contains MATLAB code for the compass-gait walker based on the paper **"The Indirect Method for Generating Optimal Periodic Trajectories and Its Application to Economical Bipedal Walking."** The code demonstrates generating passive gaits using both the **indirect** and **direct methods** described in the paper.
